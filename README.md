# darkmode-mediaquery
Sample CSS Code for Media Queries on Screen Mode (dark/light)

## Update May 22, 2019
This functionality is now supported in Firefox 67, which was released yesterday.

## Initial Update:
As of right now, this only works with Safari Technology Preview (Release 74), but this is a good demo for how to run a media query and how to trigger a jQuery code based on whether or not the user is in dark mode or light mode.
